## Project brief

The following sub-sections summarize the user requirements.

### User Story

```
AS A home buyer or renter with a busy schedule
I WANT to locate properties that fit my chosen criteria
SO THAT I can allocate my time towards ONLY properties of interest
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a property search organizer
WHEN I open the planner
THEN I am asked to select a suburb, number of bedrooms, property type, price range etc
THEN I am asked to enter a 'frequent travel location'. This could be work, university, school etc
THEN I am select my mode of travel
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with relevant properties in that suburb based on my criteria.

WHEN I hover on the option
THEN I can save the link to local storage (persists after browser restart or refresh)

WHEN I click on an option
THEN I can view a summary of the property including  suburb, number of bedrooms, property type, price range and travel time from my chosen location

WHEN I click on a save button, I can save this to my saved properties.

    WHEN I am in my saved properties page
    THEN I am presented with my saved properties in a table.
    WHEN I view the table
    THEN I can see the property details and my travel time to my 'frequent travel location' AND an option to assign a personal score to prioritize the property
    WHEN I reload the saved properties page, my properties are automatically sorted by Auction date AND THEN by my score.
    WHEN I view the saved properties page; past, present and future auction dates are highlighted accordingly.
